# Facebook Group Keyword Notifications

Facebook used to have the ability to save any search in a group so that it would notify you if new posts came up that matched your search.
I miss that, so I wanted to try make a script that does that.

This is a work in progress and currently doesn't do anything at all.
I will update this readme as I make progress
